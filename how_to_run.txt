//*********** RUN BOTH FRONTEND AND BACKENED WITH npm run dev *****





Perfect! Let’s now deploy your **frontend (Vite + React)** to Render.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Deploy Frontend (Vite/React) to Render

### 📁 Assume folder structure like:

```
/your-repo
  /client        <-- frontend (Vite)
    /src
    .env
  /backend       <-- backend (already deployed)
```

---

## ✅ Step 1: Prepare `.env` in `/client`

Open your `client/.env` file and update this line:

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://<your-backend-name>.onrender.com
```

Replace `<your-backend-name>` with the actual name or URL you got after backend deployment. For example:

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://convo-backend.onrender.com
```

✅ This tells the frontend where to send API requests.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Go to Render → Click **“New +” → “Static Site”**

---

## ✅ Step 3: Fill Form Like This:

| Field                 | Value                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Name**              | `convo-frontend` (or your choice) |
| **Root Directory**    | `./client`                        |
| **Build Command**     | `npm run build`                   |
| **Publish Directory** | `dist`                            |
| **Environment**       | Node                              |

---

## ✅ Step 4: Add Environment Variable

Click on **"Add Environment Variable"**:

| Key                | Value                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `VITE_BACKEND_URL` | `https://convo-backend.onrender.com` |

> ⚠️ Even though it's in `.env`, adding it in Render ensures it's used during build.

---

## ✅ Step 5: Click “Create Static Site” 🚀

Render will:

* Install dependencies
* Run your Vite build
* Publish your site

In 1–2 minutes, your frontend will be live at a URL like:

```
https://convo-frontend.onrender.com
```

---

## ✅ Final Check

In your frontend code (`client/src`), make sure you're using:

```js
const API = import.meta.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL;
```
