## 🔥 Your Current Status

✅ Friend request system
✅ One-to-one messaging
🚧 Want to add: **WebRTC** for audio/video calls
🎯 Goal: Make the app **advanced + real-world usable**

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Add WebRTC for Video/Audio Calling

### ✅ What is WebRTC?

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) allows:

* **Peer-to-peer** video and audio calls
* **No third-party server** for media — only signaling server needed

### 🔧 How to Use WebRTC in Your Chat App:

#### Step 1: Setup Signaling (Use Socket.IO)

Use your existing chat socket connection for signaling messages like:

* `offer`
* `answer`
* `ice-candidate`

#### Step 2: Create PeerConnection

```js
const peer = new RTCPeerConnection();
```

#### Step 3: Get User Media

```js
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
  .then(stream => {
    localVideo.srcObject = stream;
    stream.getTracks().forEach(track => peer.addTrack(track, stream));
  });
```

#### Step 4: Exchange Offer/Answer through Socket.IO

* Caller: createOffer → send to receiver via socket
* Receiver: setRemoteDescription → createAnswer → send back

#### Step 5: Exchange ICE Candidates

* Use `peer.onicecandidate` to send ICE info via socket
