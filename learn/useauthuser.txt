Of course! Let's now **explain your `useAuthUser` hook** as if we are teaching a **class 2 student** 🧒 — **very simple**, **step by step**, and **with examples** so that you understand every tiny part.

## 🔶 What is This File?

This file is a **custom hook** called `useAuthUser`. A **hook** is like a small helper that we can use to do some special work in our React app.

This particular helper is used to **check who the user is** (are they logged in or not).

---

## 🧱 Let's Break It Line by Line

```js
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
```

👉 This line means:

> “Hey! I want to use something called `useQuery` from the `@tanstack/react-query` library.”

**🔍 What is `useQuery`?**
It helps us **get data from the server** (like from an API) and **automatically handles**:

* loading
* errors
* caching
* refreshing

Imagine you're **asking your mom what's for dinner** every day. Instead of asking again and again, `useQuery` remembers it for you, handles errors if she doesn't answer, and updates the answer if dinner changes. 🍽️

---

```js
import { getAuthUser } from "../lib/api";
```

👉 This means:

> “I want to use the function called `getAuthUser`, which is saved in a file called `api.js` inside a folder named `lib`.”

**What does `getAuthUser` do?**
It is a function that talks to the backend and says:

> “Hey server, tell me who is logged in!”

---

```js
const useAuthUser = () => {
```

🧠 This line starts a new function called `useAuthUser`. This is a **custom hook** — our own small helper.

---

```js
  const authUser = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["authUser"],
    queryFn: getAuthUser,
    retry: false,
  });
```

Now inside our helper:

### Let's understand each part:

#### 🧩 `useQuery({...})`

We are using `useQuery` to **fetch the user’s login info**.

#### 📌 `queryKey: ["authUser"]`

Think of this like giving your request a **name tag** — "Hey, this query is for 'authUser'".

Just like writing **"Priyanshu's Notebook"**, this tells React Query:

> "This is about the authenticated user."

It helps React Query **cache** or remember this query.

#### 📞 `queryFn: getAuthUser`

This says:

> "To get the data, please call this function — `getAuthUser`."

This is the function that **asks the server who the user is**.

#### 🚫 `retry: false`

This means:

> "Don't keep trying again and again if it fails."

Why? Because:

* If the user is **not logged in**, we don’t want to retry again and again.
* It’s okay to get the answer once.

---

```js
  return { isLoading: authUser.isLoading, authUser: authUser.data?.user };
```

This line is saying:

> "When someone uses this helper, give them two things:"

1. `isLoading` ➡️ Tells if the request is still happening (like saying "Please wait...").
2. `authUser` ➡️ The actual user info if they are logged in.

We get this from:

* `authUser.data?.user`

  * This means: "Go to the response data and find the `user` inside it — but only if data exists."

---

```js
};
export default useAuthUser;
```

📦 Finally, we say:

> "Make this function available to other parts of the app."

So now anywhere in the app, we can say:

```js
const { authUser, isLoading } = useAuthUser();
```

## 🧸 Example in Real Life

Let’s say your app is like a school classroom. When you enter, the teacher wants to check:

👩‍🏫 “Who are you?”

This hook is like a helper who whispers:

> "Hey teacher, this student is Priyanshu, he is logged in."

And if the teacher is still checking, it says:

> "Still checking..."

If no one is logged in, it says:

> "No user found."
