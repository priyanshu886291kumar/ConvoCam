1️⃣ How Two People Start a Video Call in Your App
User A clicks the video call button for User B in the chat UI.
User A’s frontend navigates to /call/:userBId and opens the call UI.
User A’s frontend and User B’s frontend both connect to your backend using Socket.io (as set up in your server.js).
WebRTC signaling (offer, answer, ice-candidate) is exchanged between User A and User B via Socket.io events.
WebRTC establishes a peer-to-peer connection between User A and User B for video/audio.
The video call starts: both users see and hear each other directly, using their browsers’ WebRTC APIs.
2️⃣ What They Use
Socket.io: For signaling (exchanging call requests, offers, answers, and ICE candidates) between users via your backend server.
WebRTC: For direct, peer-to-peer video and audio streaming between the two users’ browsers.
Your backend server: Only used for signaling, not for the actual video/audio data.
3️⃣ Summary of the Flow
Socket.io: Used for signaling (setup and negotiation).
WebRTC: Used for the actual video/audio call (peer-to-peer).
Your backend: Relays signaling messages, but does not handle video/audio streams.
In short:

Users connect to your backend with Socket.io for signaling.
WebRTC is used for the real video/audio call between browsers.
Your backend is only a “messenger” for the signaling phase.
